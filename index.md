I work with many genomes, transcriptomes, and TAD data. I focus on how social organisation evolved, which leads me to whole-genome assemblies, variant analyses, transcriptomic analyses, 3D contact mapping of the genome. Officially holding a PhD since February 2020, my days as postdoc contain plenty of bioinformatics analyses, writing-up sessions and mentoring.
