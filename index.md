I work with many genomes, transcriptomes, and TAD data. I focus on how social organisation evolved, which leads me to whole-genome assemblies, variant analyses, transcriptomic analyses, 3D contact mapping of the genome. My days as Bioinformatician contain plenty of analyses, writing-up sessions and mentoring. I am looking for a position in the Spring 2023 - hire me!
