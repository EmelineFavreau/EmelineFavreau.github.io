# Bioinformatics, genomics & pipelines
Bioinformatician at University of Cambridge with [Prof Chris Wallace](http://chr1swallace.github.io/), working on the INTREPID project.

I write pipelines to handle rare disease molecular data and produce reports for clinicians (see my [CV](https://emelinefavreau.github.io/cv/)). I [blogged](https://emelinefavreau.github.io/blog/) about my previous work with animal genomes, transcriptomes, and TAD data. 

I provide a unique technical-research bridge to support and enhance the research of a large, dynamic group with multiple project heads. I have a track record of improving both research findings and technical operations, from foundational data analyses to advanced pipeline development and interpretation.

Want to know more? Reach out to [me](https://emelinefavreau.github.io/contact/) and read some [papers](https://emelinefavreau.github.io/publications/).

I also keep an eye on Batten disease literature, [see our French outreach website on CLN3 disease](http://cln.jmfavreau.info/index.html).
