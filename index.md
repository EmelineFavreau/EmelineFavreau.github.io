I study how social organisation of ants evolved, which leads me from field collection sites to whole-genome variants. Within a few months of finishing my PhD, my days contain plenty of bioinformatics analyses and writing-up sessions. Contact me if you want to collaborate, and/or if you are looking for a postdoc researcher.
