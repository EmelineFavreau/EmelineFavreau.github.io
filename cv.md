### Research position
- 2023 - ongoing: Bioinformatician in rare disease in [Prof Chris Wallace's lab](http://chr1swallace.github.io/).
- 2019 - 2023: NERC-funded Postdoc in [Seirian Sumner's lab](http://www.sumnerlab.co.uk/the-group/emeline-favreau/), in collaboration with Katie Geist, [Amy Toth](https://www.ent.iastate.edu/people/amy-toth) and [Sandra Rehan](http://www.rehanlab.com/). This highly collaborative postdoc focuses on understanding the origins of sociality in the wasps and the bees: comparative transcriptomics and genomics.

### Education
- 2015 – 2019: PhD in ant genomics, [QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/staff/emelinefavreau.html). Supervisors: Yannick Wurm and Max Reuter. [NERC-funded Doctoral Training Programme](https://london-nerc-dtp.org/).
- 2013 - 2014: MRes Biosystematics at Imperial College London & Natural History Museum, London (NHM).
- 2008 - 2011: BSc Environmental Sciences at Oxford Brookes University, Oxford 1st Class (Hons).

### Technical
- Bioinformatics for population genetics & genome/transcriptome wrangling
   - R current favourite packages: ggplot, tidyverse, adegenet
   - Python: matplotlib, pandas, numpy
   - Bash: tmux, vim, sbatch, qsub
   - Database: mysql (creating new schema, updating current database, extracting data for management and curation)
   - Pipeline optimisation: HPC resource management to tailor Nextflow pipeline nf-core/sarek to a large re-mapping project
   - Reproducibility: RMarkdown reports, Github version control, Nextflow (nf-core/rnaseq), Singularity, Docker
   - _De novo_ genome assembly (PacBio, MinION, Illumina, HiC), genome annotation (genes, lncRNA, TE), variant calling (SNP, SV, copy number variant), GWAS, population genomics
   - RNAseq QC and Transcriptome analyses: DESeq2, WGCNA
   - Machine learning: Support Vector Machine (to predict caste from wasp RNAseq data)
   - Data Management: I defined the strategy for long-term data storage for the Sumner Lab, and developed a system for all members to safely save their data (genomes, transcriptomes, annotations)

- Wet lab skills for sequencing (short and long reads)
   - RNA / DNA extraction and QC (all developmental stages of insect)
   - Primer selection
   - Library preparation for microsatellite, whole-genome sequencing (Illumina and MinION), RNAseq

- Fieldwork in temperate, semi-tropical and desertic areas (usually looking at ants and wasps)
