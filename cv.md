### Research positions
- Since May 2023: Bioinformatician in Rare Diseases in [Prof Chris Wallace's lab](http://chr1swallace.github.io/). Handling data from a cohort of patients with Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEI). Designing and conducting analyses for 4 research groups.

    - Mapping thousands of genomes to GRCh38 and calling small and structural variants for rare diseases in the team of biostatistician [Dr Ernest Turro](https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/turrolab/members/) and Dr Daniel Greene.
    - Calling variants and annotating their effects with VEP in the team of immunologist [Prof Matthew Cook](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/staff-directory/professor-matthew-cook/), with [Dr Kristy Kwong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristykxm/) and [Dr Yuki Kawamura](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2137-6464).
    - Variant calling, annotation and ancestry analysis in a cohort of cancer patients, with Prof Matthew Cook and [Dr Yuwei Hao](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3932-3686).
    - Managing a reliable archiving solution to preserve patient data (flow cytometry, WGS, transcriptomics) for both secure storage and input to R&D.

- 2008 - 2011: BSc Environmental Sciences at Oxford Brookes University, Oxford 1st Class (Hons).

### Technical
- Bioinformatics for population genetics & genome/transcriptome wrangling
   - R current favourite packages: ggplot, tidyverse, adegenet
   - Python: matplotlib, pandas, numpy
   - Bash: tmux, vim, sbatch, qsub
   - Database: MySQL (creating new schema, updating current database, extracting data for management and curation)
   - Pipeline optimisation: HPC resource management to tailor Nextflow pipeline nf-core/sarek to a large re-mapping project
   - Reproducibility: RMarkdown reports, Github/Gitlab version control, Nextflow (nf-core/rnaseq, sarek), Singularity, Docker
   - _De novo_ genome assembly (PacBio, MinION, Illumina, HiC), genome annotation (genes, lncRNA, TE), variant calling (SNP, SV, copy number variant), GWAS, population genomics, ancestry analysis (plink)
   - RNAseq QC and Transcriptome analyses: DESeq2, WGCNA
   - Machine learning: Support Vector Machine (to predict caste from wasp RNAseq data)
   - Data Management: I defined the strategy for long-term data storage for the Sumner Lab, and developed a system for all members to safely save their data (genomes, transcriptomes, annotations)

In the past, you could also find me in the wet lab (MinION, RNA, DNA, microsatellites) and in the field (sampling invertebrates worldwide).
