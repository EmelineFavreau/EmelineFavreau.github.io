### Education

- 2015 – ongoing: PhD in ant genomics, [QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/staff/emelinefavreau.html). Supervisors: Dr Yannick Wurm and Dr Max Reuter. [NERC-funded Doctoral Training Programme](https://london-nerc-dtp.org/).
- 2013 - 2014: MRes Biosystematics at Imperial College London & Natural History Museum, London (NHM).
- 2008 - 2011: BSc Environmental Sciences at Oxford Brookes University, Oxford 1st Class (Hons).

### Technical
- Bioinformatics skills tailored for statistics and variant calling. Depending on needs, analyses conducted on my own computer or high performance computer:
   - R statistical package
   - Bash
   - Version control system
   - _De novo_ genome assembly
   - Variant calling
   - GWAS
   - Population genomics

- Wet lab skills tailored for sequencing (short and long reads). Depending on needs, I follow established protocols/kits, or design my own:
   - DNA extraction and QC
   - Primer selection
   - Library preparation for microsatellite and whole-genome sequencing (Illumina and MinION)
