title:  "Happy New Year"

---

I wish I could say what happened in 2020 stays in 2020. But there are plenty of good things that happened and one should celebrate the little wins and the big wows. 

2020 was the first full year as a postdoc: I worked with great colleagues and students, and I learn a lot while joining the Sumner lab. I will also remember obtaining the [Godfrey Hewitt mobility grant from ESEB](https://eseb.org/prizes-funding/godfrey-hewitt-mobility-award/), and organising the NWE IUSSI online conference. I loved reading cool science from friends (about [ants](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55862) and [turtles](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75498-4)) and from the research community at large ([SARS-CoV-2 vaccine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577) and [hope to treat Batten disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32719489/)).

In 2021, I look forward to get more work published, to learn even more from our scientific community, to tackle some brain-hurting challenges be it technical or theoretical. I also look forward to some recurrent conferences, such as [PopGroup](https://www.populationgeneticsgroup.org.uk/); as well as some new ways of networking and navigating my way in the postdoc world. Reach out to me if you "see" me attending the same conference as you.
