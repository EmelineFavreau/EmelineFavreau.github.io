title:  "Pint of Science: come for a drink, stay for the science!"

---

I was invited to present my research in a London pub - so much fun! This was an event organised by [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk/), encouraging **scientists to share their projects to local pub goers**.

The mission of this international science festival is simple: share a drink and exchange science facts. Each local pub, caf√© or communal space hosts an evening of talks for the local audience. I really like it because the event is breaking down potential barriers between the academic world and local community. 

I was thrown in front of an unknown crowd, not unlike [SoapboxScience](http://soapboxscience.org/). Within twenty minutes, I could explain my current research: how to use genomics to understand the evolution of social organisation. I decided to **include few stories from fieldwork** - this often what captures people's attention. I also explored ideas around evolutionary times: this is what keeps me happy in my job and I always **break it down in small chunks of knowledge** that is easy to reach for an interested teenager. I aimed to **keep the slides simple**: the audience could easily visualise data to derive insights.

This was a fantastic event with many questions from the keen audience. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and would recommend to attend these events!
