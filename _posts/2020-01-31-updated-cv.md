title:  "Updated CV"

---

Carrying on with my previous post, I have now updated my [cv](cv.md). Research has been tremedously eye-opening, thanks to the fantastic collaboration with [Katie Geist](https://github.com/ksgeist), my "postdoc twin" from Amy Toth's lab. More to come from this very soon! I have been equally busy with mentoring students, organising a conference and helping the UCL GEE postdoc community by acting as postdoc representative.
