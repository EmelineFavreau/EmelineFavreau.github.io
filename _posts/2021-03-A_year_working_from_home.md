title:  "A year working from home"

---

2020-2021 in London have been great to reducing my commuting time to two seconds from my bedroom to my living-room. Challenges were many however, especially when establishing and nurturing intercontinental collaborations. Katie ([postdoc at Iowa State University](https://github.com/ksgeist)) and I have been working on each side of the pond, untangling the association between molecular processes and evolution of sociality. Here are few tips that worked for us.

_Github essentials: you can fork a project and work on a new branch_

Collaboration thrives on **continuous communication**. We use emails for important topics, and we used Slack for keeping track of actions. We moved on to a shared Google folder with more flexibility to share, change and organise.

We found that **recurrent video calls** were important to keep us on track, celebrating small milestones and big personal wins. We discuss findings, troubleshoot issues, organise logistics (e.g. sampling and sequencing). As we slowly realised that I will not be able to go to Iowa as planned due to the pandemic, we started to **co-work on Zoom** in my late afternoons and Katie's early mornings: we meet at a specific time, we state our aims, and work on mute until one of us needs to ask a question. As we work on the same datasets with slightly different tools, this coworking window allows us to get immediate fixes on small issues.

We quickly started a **common Github directory**, where we push our code and datasets. This allows a great parallelisation of work, as long as we do not forget to pull first ([more info here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/getting-changes-from-a-remote-repository)). Github projects have a great kanban organisation tab, where I can create task list and update them from TO DO to IN PROGRESS. With a 5 hour difference between us, this card system is efficient to quickly communicate the analysis progress.

Emulating real life interations is not straight-forward, and I am sure we'll look back on this time with bitter sweet curiosity.
