title:  "Using Github"

---

_Why should I use Github?_, a friend recently asked. _I write code for my job and share scripts with colleagues. I think Github could be useful, but I feel a bit intimidated by the technical bits._ I thought about it and replied with few tips that I learnt on the way. This is a summary.

_Github essentials: you can fork a project and work on a new branch_

Science relies in **reproducible** research, with carefully laid-out hypotheses, optimised protocols, rigorous reports that are peer-reviewed. Science is also about **collaboration**: "hey, did you manage to use the new cluster? how did you do that?". For these two obvious reasons, sharing an R code or a bash command is quite useful if it involves some version-control, sharable system. This is what [UCL recommends when publishing an article](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/news/2020/jul/research-software-development-ucl-where-were-and-how-to-do-it-better), and [what I try to do with my colleagues](https://github.com/EmelineFavreau/ucl-cluster-tips-for-wasps).

Getting used to Github was not so easy at first, because it was quite alien to what I knew. I first used it to update a website: each learning step was often loaded with a small mistake that would inevitably crash the website. I frequently spent time to fix these bugs, with the immediate gratification of seeing the website working, and the long-term benefit of **[understanding git](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github)**. Nowadays I find Github useful for my own personal website (read more here to **[make your own website](https://github.com/github/personal-website)**).

I try to commit and push regularly in all my projects. This allows me to have a **somewhat secure back-up of scripts if the end of times happens**. I always talked about this in hypothetical terms, until I was deprived of HPC access for the whole month of May. I easily found my scripts on the remote repository and could play with ggplot. I have also **stored [some script templates](https://github.com/EmelineFavreau/ucl-cluster-tips-for-wasps/blob/master/analysis-template.Rmd)** that I can copy and paste easily off the website remote repository. 

I currently use Github to **understand the tools that I use**, by looking at the source code or the comments of the issues. Some users might have had the same error message than me, and it is great to find a fix in the closed issue posts. I also **keep an eye on few of my bioinformatic crushes** (you can follow and star projects, organisations or users): what they are currently using might be the next big thing that everyone wants to use. 

Lastly, there is this **beautiful data visualisation** on the front page of each user, showing moments of intense use of Github with little green tiles. It is nice to reflect on the past to see the big pushes. I know that it motivates some to fill in the blank too!
