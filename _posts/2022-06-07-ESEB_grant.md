title:  "New skills after networking in Barcelona's bioinformatics hotspot"

---

Right at the start of my postdoc, I applied for the [ESEB Godfrey Hewitt Mobility Award](https://eseb.org/prizes-funding/godfrey-hewitt-mobility-award/) to expand my questions on the evolution of social organisation to larger datasets, namely the non-coding regions of genomes (lncRNA). I was successful in obtaining the €1,600 grant at the turn of the new year 2020. Needless to say, the next two years proved more chaotic than anticipated.

In March 2022, I travelled to Barcelona and spent the month collaborating with Head of Evolutionary Genomics Group [Prof M. Mar Albà Soler](https://t.co/je6biDoDmj) at the GRIB ([Research Programme on Biomedical Informatics in Barcelona Biomedical Research Park](http://grib.imim.es/about-us/)). I wanted to learn more about lncRNA and developed my Python skills. The warm welcome that I received from Mar and her research team was fantastic: I had access to a desk in the shared office, I attended weekly lab meetings and seminars, I could ask dumb/direct technical and biological questions on my project. At the end of the month, my exploration of long-coding regions had jumpstarted to solid analyses (that are still running), and I was proud to present results in a Jupyter notebook. 

While I was there, Mar received awesome news: her ERC project was funded, and she is currently recruiting. If you are/know of a postdoc who likes to explore long non-coding areas AND playing beach volley after work, (apply here)[http://evolutionarygenomics.imim.es/group/?page_id=1911].
