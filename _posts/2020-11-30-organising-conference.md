title:  "Organising a conference"

---

Each year social insect researchers gather around to share their findings, sometimes at the NHM in London, sometimes somewhere else in the UK. This year, and thanks to the internet, the Winter Meeting will be happening in each isolated/confined office. I have been organising the logistics of a three-day conference of the [North-Western European Section of the International Union for the Study of Social Insects](http://www.iussi.org/NWEurope/meetings.htm).

I have been attending this Winter Meeting since 2015, so I thought it was time to give back to the community. With the help of a fantastic organising committee (Liz Bates, Anindita Brahma, Valentin Lecheval, Gabriel Luis Hernandez, Benjamin Hanson, Federico López-Osorio), we put together a headline that is diverse in scientific themes. This attracted more than 100 registrations from scientists from many countries in Europe and further afield. We will have a healthy combination of Zoom talks and flash-talks for posters, a Slack forum dedicated to all social insect chatter.
