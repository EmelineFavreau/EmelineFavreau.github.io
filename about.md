I was recently specialising in social insects comparative genomics and transcriptomics to understand the evolution of social organisation, from the field (1%) to the lab (1%) and the cluster (98%). My PhD was in ant genomics in London at [Queen Mary University of London](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/research/) in [Yannick Wurm's lab](https://wurmlab.github.io/team/efavreau/index.html). My postdoc at UCL with [Prof Seirian Sumner](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/people/dr-seirian-sumner) explored data and develop pipelines to understand the origins of sociality in the wasps and the bees.

I also keep an eye on Batten disease literature, [see our French outreach website on Batten disease](http://cln.jmfavreau.info/index.html).
