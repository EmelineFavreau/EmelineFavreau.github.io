# Evolution, bioinformatics, genomics & social insects
Bioinformatics PostDoc at University College London with [Prof Seirian Sumner](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/people/dr-seirian-sumner), I am currently specialising in social insects comparative genomics and transcriptomics to understand the evolution of social organisation, from the field (5%) to the lab (10%) and the cluster (85%). Within an international collaboration (UK, USA, Canada) I am responsible to explore data and develop pipelines to understand the origins of sociality in the wasps and the bees.

I was recently awarded a PhD in ant genomics in London at [Queen Mary University of London](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/research/) in [Yannick Wurm's lab](https://wurmlab.github.io/team/efavreau/index.html).
My PhD project title is _One or multiple ant queens? The genetic architectures underlying convergent evolution of a fundamental social trait_. Read more about what I was doing in [a Myrmecological News interview](https://blog.myrmecologicalnews.org/2019/03/20/doing-an-ant-phd-emeline-favreau/) and [The Biologist's A Day in the Life of](Biologist_interview.png).

I also keep an eye on human biology literature, [see our French outreach website on Batten disease](http://cln.jmfavreau.info/index.html).
